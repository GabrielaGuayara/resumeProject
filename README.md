# Building a resume using HTML and CSS
This is a practice assignment about CSS and HTML. I implemented a grid layout and some quearies to make the webpage resposive. However, I still need to make more improvements so that the page can be resposive on cellphone.
I also use netlify.com to deploy my website, so please click [here](
